# exploitdb-json-api
JSON API for ExploitDB Website

# Requirements 

Install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/), and a MySQL database.

# How to install it? 

Clone my repo and the submodule ([Exploit database repo](https://github.com/offensive-security/exploit-database.git)).
To do so: 

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/PaulSec/exploitdb-json-api.git
cd exploitdb-json-api
```

Then, create database and exploits table using the sql file: 

```
mysql -uroot < create.sql
```

Move or copy files.csv (from Exploitdb project in /tmp/) and change the permissions to the file

```
mv exploitdb/files.csv /tmp/files.csv
chown mysql:mysql /tmp/files.csv
```

Import the data in the database: 

```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE "/tmp/files.csv"
INTO TABLE exploitdb.exploits
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;
```

And finally (pfewww), change credentials to access the db in the ```model.js``` file. 

# Launch it

Two commands will do it: 

```
npm install
node server.js
```

# Use it

Server should be accessible at: 
```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/exploits
```
This will retrieve you *ALL* the exploits (Be careful). 

## Filtering

### Filter by Author:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/exploits?author=paul
```

### Filter by Description:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/exploits?description=Linux
```

### Filter by Date:
You can search older exploits specifying the **before** filter (equivalent to a <=). 
```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/exploits?before=2005
```

Or the **after** one (equivalent to a >=): 
```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/exploits?after=2005
```

### Filter by Type:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/exploits?type=dos
```

Different type are: remote, local, webapps, dos, shellcode.

### Filter by Platform:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/exploits?platform=linux
```

Different platform are: windows, linux, solaris, php, osx, bsd, cgi, hardware, multiple, hp-ux, tru64, sco, novell, irix, unix, aix, win32, ultrix, asp, qnx, plan9, jsp, openbsd, minix, freebsd, android, ios, netbsd_x86, bsd_ppc, bsd_x86, bsdi_x86, freebsd_x86, freebsd_x86-64, generator, lin_amd64, linux_mips, linux_ppc, linux_sparc, lin_x86, lin_x86-64, openbsd_x86, osx_ppc, sco_x86, solaris_sparc, solaris_x86, unixware, win64, arm, cfm, netware, sh4, java, beos, immunix, palm_os, atheos, mips, xml.

### Filter by Port:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/exploits?port=80
```

## Combining filters

Obviously, you can combine them all:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/exploits?author=paul&description=Linux&before=2005&type=dos
```

## Getting information about a specific exploit

```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/exploits/2/
```

returns you a JSON response which looks like: 

```json
[{"id":2,"file":"platforms/windows/remote/2.c","description":"Microsoft Windows WebDAV - Remote PoC Exploit","_date":"2003-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","author":"RoMaNSoFt","platform":"windows","type":"remote","port":"80"}]
```

## Retrieving a specific PoC

```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/exploits/2/attachment
```
retrieves you the attachment (the exploit file) for the exploit using the id 2.
